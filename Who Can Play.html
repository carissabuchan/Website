<h1>Who Can Play</h1>
<p>Volleyball is a sport that is safe, fun and does not require extreme fitness.
    Since you don’t have to move around the court too much, it’s great for people who want a low-impact sport that will help them get fit without pushing them to their limit.
    For those who are a bit more competitive, the sport is fantastic because games can be really exciting and intense, but there’s always a net between you and your opponents.</p>
    <p>Beach volleyball is suitable for people of all ages, and men and women alike.</p>
    <p>Anyone considering starting a new sport or exercise program should see their doctor first.</p>
